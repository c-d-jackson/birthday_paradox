# Birthday Paradox Simulation

Learning collaborative git through the Birthday Paradox. Simulations and Viz.

## The Questions

In a room of N people, what's the probability that at least two people share a birthday?
What's the probability that at least P people share the same birthday?

## Project Goals

Practice collaboration: branching, merging, and resolving conflicts

## Files

- `birthday_paradox.Rmd` - Main R Markdown file with simulation and visualizations
- `.gitignore` - Excludes generated files (HTML, cache, etc.)

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0+)
- RStudio (recommended)
- R packages: `ggplot2`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

## Git Workflow

We're using this project to practice:
- Creating feature branches
- Making pull requests
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Code review

### Suggested branches:
- `simulation-functions` - Implement the core simulation logic
- `theoretical-calculations` - Add theoretical probability calculations
- `visualization` - Create plots and charts
- `comparison-plots` - Compare simulation vs theory

## Extensions

Ideas for expanding the project:
- Vary the number of days in a year
- Consider birth months instead of exact dates
- Visualize distributions of matching pairs
- Explore the "almost birthday" problem (birthdays within k days)
